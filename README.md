## Prerequisites

- Read through
  ["JavaScript to Know for React"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- Install the React DevTools
  ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
  (recommended),
  [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `^10.13 || 12 || 14 || 15`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/antoniel/epicReact.git
cd *
node setup
```
